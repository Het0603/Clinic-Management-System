Overview

The Clinic Health Care Tool is designed to improve the management and coordination of patient data, appointments, and other clinical processes in a health care setting. It enables health care providers to access patient records quickly, schedule and track appointments, and keep records organized.

Features
Patient Management: Add, view, edit, and delete patient profiles.
Appointment Scheduling: Schedule, view, and manage appointments.
Data Security: Basic authentication to ensure data privacy.
Dashboard: Overview of clinic operations, including statistics on patients and appointments.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive for seamless use across devices.
Technology Stack
React + Vite: Provides a fast, modular, and efficient development environment.
@vitejs/plugin-react: This setup uses Babel for Fast Refresh, ensuring a quick feedback loop during development.
ESLint: Enforced code quality and consistency with ESLint rules.
Why Vite?
Vite offers faster development with instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build times, making it ideal for React projects. Vite’s lightweight setup accelerates development speed and provides a minimal configuration out of the box.
